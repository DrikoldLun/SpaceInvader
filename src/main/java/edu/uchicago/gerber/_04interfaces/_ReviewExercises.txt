R9.2 superclass and subclass
Since we just need to manage the inventory, we don't need to care about the different method implementation of those applications,
it's more direct to use an ArrayList to store the application object with some common properties.

R9.4 SavingsAccount
It inherits the method deposit, getBalance
It overrides the method withdraw, monthEnd
It adds the method SavingsAccount(construction method), setInterestRate

R9.6 Sandwich
a,d are legal, b,c are illegal

R9.8 Inheretence -use the UML diagram tool in IntelliJ and indicate to the grader where uml file is located
Please see R9_8.uml

R9.9 Inheretence -use the UML diagram tool in IntelliJ and indicate to the grader where uml file is located

R9.10 Casting
As for (BankAccount) x cast, it can't be compiled successfully if BankAccount is a subclass of the object class of x,
when BankAccount is the super class of the object class of x, it's possible that x will lose some properties,
as for those retained properties, the value of the primitives and the instance variables are not changed, but the methods may have different implementation.
As for (int) x cast, it can actually change the underlying primitive value of x.

R9.11 instanceof operator
a,b,d,e returns true

R9.14 Edible interface
a,c,h are legal
