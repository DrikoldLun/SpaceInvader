R12.1 OO Analysis and Design
1. Gather requirements.
2. Use CRC cards to find classes, responsibilities, and collaborators.
3. Use UML diagrams to record class relationships.
4. Use javadoc to document method behavior.
5. Implement the program.

R12.2 OO Analysis and Design
Highlight the nouns in the problem description. Make a list of the nouns.
Cross out those that donâ€™t seem to be reasonable candidates for classes.

R12.3 OO Analysis and Design
Make a list of the major tasks that your system needs to fulfill. From those tasks, pick one
that is not trivial and that is intuitive to you. Find a class that is responsible for carrying out
that task. Make an index card and write the name and the task on it. Now ask yourself how
an object of the class can carry out the task. It probably needs help from other objects. Then
make CRC cards for the classes to which those objects belong and write the responsibilities (methods)
on them.
