R1.5 The following are all benefits to using Java over machine code:
1/ Java bytecode is platform independent and may be run on any system that has a JVM. This quality is known as portability.
2/ Java JIT compilers can run efficient Java programs as fast or faster than machine code programs
3/ Java is memory-managed. This reduces about 95% of runtime errors (mostly memory-related) as compared to unmanaged code.
4/ Java was designed for networking and the Internet in mind; and it is generally safer than machine code
5/ With the introduction of Java8, Java is now a declarative and functional programming language.

R2.4
s = s0 + v0*t + 0.5*g*Math.pow(t,2)
FV = PV*Math.pow(1+INT/100,YRS)
G = 4*Math.pow(Math.PI,2)*Math.pow(a,3)/(Math.pow(p,2)*(m1+m2))
c = Math.sqrt(a*a+b*b-2*a*b*Math.cos(y))

R2.14
2 is an int, which is primitive, occupying 4 bytes
2.0 is a float, which is primitive, occupying 4 bytes
'2' is a char, which is primitive, occupying 2 bytes
"2" is a String containing 1 character, which is non-primitive
"2.0" is a String containing 3 characters, which is non-primitive

R2.17
Input the name and store it as a String object nameStr
Set the boolean isprint = false
Traverse nameStr from i=0 to i=nameStr.length()-1{
    get the char ch as the (i+1)th character of nameStr
    if isprint is true{
        print the uppercase of ch
    }
    else{
        if ch is the whitespace, set isprint = true
        else set isprint = false
    }
}

while loop: when the maximum times of loops is not stated and the condition judgement is at the beginning of each loop
do while loop: when the maximum times of loops is not stated and the condition judgement is at the end of each loop
for loop: when the maximum times of loops is stated

R4.14
Label (i) Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat,Sun with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0
print line "Su  M  T  W  Th  F  Sa"
select an arbitrary date with year(y0),month(m0),day(d0) and weekday label(i0) already known
initialize an char arr arrChar[7] = [' ']*7
loop the date in the specified month in a specified year{
    calculate the day difference diff_day between this date (y,m,d) and date(y0,m0,d0)
    arrChar[(diff_day+i0)%7] = tochar(d) //tochar is a function to convert int to char
    if ((diff_day+i0)%7 == 6 or this is the end of the loop){
        print arrChar into a line, and each element is seperated by "  "
        begin the next line
        arrChar[7] = [' ']*7
    }
